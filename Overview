Every thing in flutter is a widget

eventaullay we will end up creating a widget tree

widget is a fundamental building block 

if we make any changes then that perticular widget only going to change

Ajax has potential to change only one part of the screen but computer those days are not that powerful to support AJAX
gmail started using AJAX, and it became one of the fastest email service back then
